name "Input to Outputs"

-- Simple program to move things from one input to multiple outputs, sorted accordingly.
-- For this example, I'm sorting Iron, Copper, and Gold ingots.

every 20 ticks do
    input from InputStorage
    
    output iron_ingot to IronStorage
    output copper_ingot to CopperStorage
    output gold_ingot to GoldStorage
end
